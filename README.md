# 🚀 Microservices Containerization with CI/CD using Github Actions

## 📝 Overview  
This project containerizes a **microservices-based application** using **Docker, Docker Compose, and Docker Swarm**, with **CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions**.  

## **🛠 Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend (Node.js)** – UI service  
- **Backend (Node.js)** – API service  
- **Authentication (Python - FastAPI/Django)** – User authentication  
- **Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** – Persistent storage  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – Containerization & local development  
- **Docker Swarm** – Multi-container orchestration  
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipeline for automation  

## 🔄 CI/CD Automation
- GitHub Actions automates testing, building, and deployment.
- Pushes Docker images to Docker Hub.
- Deploys updates to the Swarm cluster.
  
## 📌 Use Cases
- 🔍 Containerize microservices for real-world deployments.
- 🧪 Test services in isolation before production deployment.
- 📚 CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions.
- ⚙️ Automate testing & deployment using DevOps best practices.
